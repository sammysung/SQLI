/*
    Important general notes:

    frame will pass along a driver object; this object is what controls the argument functionality, and therefore must
    also be passed to ANY class where a command line argument might change a setting.

    As of this writing, the Positive Tainting test is the only implemented test, and as such, some functionality has
    been removed, such as a test selection menu. Whether it is reimplemented or not, setting the TTest to true forces
    without user input right now. The V 0.1.1 release on Github should have the test menu in it, should you need it.

    Intellij will note that many functions are not used and that some classes are unreachable; this is not true for many
    of the cases. Anything that begins with "Test" can be assumed to be safe, as the antlr4 integration with the
    pre-existing codebase was not perfect, and Intellij cannot detect the classes until compilation time.
    Other classes that are flagged as "not used" may simply not be necessary in every run of the program.
