# General Branch Info

As of now, there is only one release using the 

`"V{current version number}-{type}"`

scheme shown, but that would be the best format for any code branches that do not exactly fit the current needs of the project, but have some worth for future features or improvements.

## Lexical Simulator

[Release Page Here](https://github.com/sammysung/SQLI/releases/tag/V0.1.2-Lex)

This was the last release that used the Lexcial Simulator code we had to help parse through string looking for hotspots; while most of the features of the simulator itself was superceded by ANTLR4, there is some custom code for parsing through static Java files and creating/analyzing hotspots that may be useful for future development.
