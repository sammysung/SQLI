# Usage
Structure: `java -jar frame.jar [-{h,f,o,d,i,v,q,w}] [input file] [output root filename] [safe file]`


**-h**: Print this help message.

**-f**: Enable command line input file naming mode (first argument will be input filename).

**-o**: Enable command line output file naming mode (third argument will be output filename if -f is present, first otherwise).

**-d**: Enables command line safe query list definition (second argument will be safe filename)

**-i**: Enable user input output file naming mode (program will prompt for output filename).

**-v**: Enable verbose mode.

**-w**: If an output filename is reused, overwrite without asking.

**-q**: Use this to signal immediate shutdown (focused for testing purposes or help message only runs).

Example: "`java -jar frame.jar -hfov in.txt out.txt`" will print the help message, read from **in.txt**, output to **out.txt**, show a test selection menu, prompt for a safe file, and be verbose.

"`java -jar frame.jar -fdow query.txt test safe.txt`" will pull input data from **query.txt**, a safe file list from **safe.txt**, output to **test{-type}.txt**, and will overwrite **test{-type}.txt** if it already exists with no prompts.

Note that order of the **-f**, **-d**, and **-o** options does not matter; the input name, then the root filename, and then the safe query list file will be read in that order every time.

By default, with no arguments, the program will prompt for user input to assign the input filename and auto generate an output filename with the scheme "*report-{UTC Local Time}.txt*".

Arguments **-i** and **-o** are mutually exclusive. The program will use the autogenerate scheme if they are used together.
