# Initial Setup

Java will need to be setup on your system in order to run this program. As it is currently a command line only tool (though this is set to change) you will need to setup a JDK for your system and ensure that command line tools can use it. Below are steps to install and/or setup Java, depending on your system OS:

## Linux (Ubuntu-based)

Simply open up a terminal and run the command:

`sudo apt install default-jre`

This should get you the most recent Java installation up and running without too much hassle. 

## Windows

First, install Java from [this site here](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

Make sure to select the Windows binary that fits your system architecture. That install will allow you to run Java programs everywhere but the command line.

To get command line Java up and running, follow the instructions [located here](https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10).

This will allow you to run java commands from any command line instance, which is not strictly necessary, but highly useful for any Java development on Windows.

## Mac

Coming soon! I haven't fixed my internet kexts on my Mac install, and I don't have my wireless dongle stopgap measure for it yet, either.

## Pathing

If, for some reason, you need to run a seperate Java install or the Windows instructions were not clear, this is the offical Oracle documentation about the PATH variable for all systems (including Solaris, for anyone who happens to use that):
